# Lyra, built on the Plow hermes base.
#
# Pinned to an immutable tag, as the base asks. There is no `latest`: one tag per
# commit of plow-hermes-agent, `base-` plus the full 40-character SHA. To move
# it, list what is published and take the newest that your checkout also has:
#
#   token=$(curl -fsSL 'https://public.ecr.aws/token/?service=public.ecr.aws&scope=repository:e1h7x4a2/plow-cloud-agents:pull' \
#     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
#   curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
#     https://public.ecr.aws/v2/e1h7x4a2/plow-cloud-agents/tags/list
#
# A 403 on pull is stale registry credentials, not the tag: docker logout
# public.ecr.aws, then build again.

# No COPY --chmod anywhere in this file. It is BuildKit-only, and a stock Docker
# still selects the legacy builder, where it fails the build outright. The base
# says so and does the mode in its own step; so do we.

# Identity. plow-init composes the home's SOUL.md on every boot as the base
# persona followed by this file, so this is an addition to a persona rather than
# a whole one, and nothing here writes /var/lib/hermes/SOUL.md directly: that
# path is overwritten at boot.

# Both copies, as the base image does with its own. The second is what a home
# that starts empty is seeded from and what later image updates reach; it is a
# source and not a backup, so a skill the agent deleted stays deleted.
